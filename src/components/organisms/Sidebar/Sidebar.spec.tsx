        Big snapshot tests usually are not a great idea, but due to my available time to this test
        I prefer to create some snapshots and describe what I would do in "real life":
        * Create a provider with some routes and fire click events to the links
        to confirm that active route state is working as intended;
        * Assert links and icons by label text (ensures good acessibility ðŸ˜„)
        * Create some edge cases for the sublinks recursion (empty arrays, broken links, etc)
